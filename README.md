# OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer for Tailscale

This layer supports arm/arm64/i386/x86_64 architectures. If your board uses an other architecture edit the download link and the corresponding folder names.

Note this recipe uses the pre-built binaries from Tailscale and does not attempt to build it from source.

The latest releases of Tailscale stable binaries can be found here: https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/#static
